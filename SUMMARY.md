# QuickBooks Time MCP Server Setup Summary

## What We've Done

We've set up the QuickBooks Time MCP server and created several helper scripts to make it easier to use:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Created a `.env` file for storing the QuickBooks Time access token
   - Installed the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

2. **Helper Scripts**:
   - `get_token.py`: A script to help users get a QuickBooks Time access token
   - `test_server.py`: A script to test if the server is working correctly
   - `run_server.bat`: A batch file for Windows users to easily run the server
   - `run_server.sh`: A shell script for Unix/Linux/Mac users to easily run the server

3. **Documentation**:
   - `SETUP.md`: Detailed setup instructions
   - `QUICKSTART.md`: A quick guide to get started
   - `SUMMARY.md`: This summary of what we've done

## How to Use the MCP Server

1. **Get a QuickBooks Time Access Token**:
   - Edit `get_token.py` to set your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Run `python get_token.py` to get an access token
   - The token will be saved to a `.env` file

2. **Test the Server**:
   - Run `python test_server.py` to test if the server is working correctly

3. **Run the Server**:
   - On Windows: Run `run_server.bat`
   - On Unix/Linux/Mac: Run `./run_server.sh`
   - Or run `python main.py` directly

4. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   - Add the MCP server configuration to Claude Desktop settings
   - Use the server with Claude to access QuickBooks Time data

## Next Steps

1. **Get a Real Access Token**:
   - Register an app at [Intuit Developer](https://developer.intuit.com/)
   - Get your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Use `get_token.py` to get a real access token

2. **Explore the API**:
   - Read the README.md file to learn about the available tools
   - Try different API endpoints to access QuickBooks Time data

3. **Customize the Server**:
   - Modify the server code to add new features or fix issues
   - Contribute to the project by submitting pull requests

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check that your access token is valid and correctly set in the .env file
- Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify that your QuickBooks Time account has the necessary permissions
- Check the server logs for error messages
